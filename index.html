  <h2>Choosing a Pet</h2>
  <p>This page will help you choose between a dog, turtle, or a bird</p>

  <h2>Dogs</h2>
  <p>Dogs are the most work, but they are also the most fun. You have to walk them every day, but they love you and will
    always play with you.</p>

  <h2>Turtles</h2>
  <!--The opening P tag was not properly typed and did not have a > resulting in the Paragraph not showing until it was fixed by retyping the tag-->
  <p>Turtles can also be fun, but they don't play with you. They will not make a mess of your room and they are quiet.
  </p>

  <h2>Birds</h2>
  <p>Birds kind of play with you, but they are a lot of trouble and might fly away or start flying all around your room
    and make a mess of it.</p>
